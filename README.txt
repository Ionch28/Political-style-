D)	‘Bad manners,' The PSD incorporated Soros myths and symbolism to designate paid protesters as 'Sorosiști,’ #hashtagiști, or #hashtagRezist (for those who organized online the protests against the OUG’s); technocrats and members of the opposition as 'Sorosiști,' ‘lazy and stupid,’ ‘gang of marauders,’ ‘mafia,' 'traitors of the country' and prosecutors as ‘Securiști’ and 'torturers.' Bad manners also included other linguistic traits that designate the president Iohannis as a 'tyrant; unpatriotic; dictator; evil; extremist; the enemy; Nazi concentration camp chief.’
